# This configures Clockwork Raven to use an LDAP server for authentication
# and authorization, and to connect to that LDAP server over SSL/TLS so
# passwords are encrypted.
#
# WARNING: Clockwork Raven uses Net::LDAP for LDAP connections.
# Net::LDAP does NOT perform validation of the LDAP server's SSL certificate.
# From the Net::LDAP docs (http://net-ldap.rubyforge.org/Net/LDAP.html):
#
# "Itâ€™s intended for cases where you have an implicit level of trust in the
# authenticity of the LDAP server"
#
# This should not be a security issue as long as you are not concerned about
# man-in-the-middle attacks (e.g. if you are behind a VPN or private network).

# Change this line to be the port your LDAP server listens on. 636 is the
# default for LDAP over SSL/TLS
